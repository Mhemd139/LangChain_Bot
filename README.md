# LangChainBot README
LangChainBot is a simple bot built using the Langchain API to generate responses to user inputs.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
ipynb library (you can install it via pip install ipynb)
## Usage
Open the LangChainBot.ipynb notebook in Jupyter.
Run the cells to set up the bot and the Langchain API client.
Input a message in the text box and press Enter to receive a response from the bot.
The bot uses a simple language model to generate responses, and it's not guaranteed to provide accurate or meaningful answers.

## Development
The bot is built using the ipynb library, which allows you to import Jupyter notebooks as modules in Python. The bot code is contained in the LangChainBot.ipynb notebook, which you can modify to change the bot's behavior.

The bot uses the langchain library to interact with the Langchain API. You can find more information about the Langchain API in the official documentation.
